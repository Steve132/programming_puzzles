My solutions to programming puzzles online.

## Naming conventions.


All problems are based on <rootname>

The rootname is different based on the source of the puzzle and the specific puzzle it solves.

Input files (if any) to a problem are specified as `<rootname>.in`. 

Output files (the expected output) to a problem is specified as `<rootname>.out`

Source files to the problem are specified as `<rootname>.<sourcefile>` which is the language source code file for the probelm>

Any notes or explainations are included in `<rootname>.notes`.

If present, the original problem text is contained in `<rootname>.spec`

##Rootnames

###Daily Programmer:

  The rootname for /r/dailyprogrammer is `dp<number>` which specifies the dailyprogrammer problem number.  For early DP problems that contain multiple difficulty levels per number, this is added as a postfix to the number, like `dp132e.py`

###Project Euler:
  The rootname for project euler is `eul<number>` which specifies the project euler problem number.
